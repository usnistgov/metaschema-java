# Metaschema Java Tools and Libraries

This open-source, Metaschema Java framework offers a set of Java libraries providing a programatic means to work with models defined by the [Metaschema modeling language](https://github.com/usnistgov/metaschema). This framework also supports programatically creating, modifying, parsing, and writing XML, JSON, and YAML instance data that conforms to a given Metaschema model. This work is intended to make it easier for Java software developers to incorporate Metaschema-based capabilities into their applications.

This is an effort by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Metaschema Project.

The Metaschema Java framework provides:

- Java objects for loading and working with XML-based Metaschema constructs. This functionality is provided by the [Metaschema XML model](metaschema-model/).
- Java bean code generation based on one or more Metaschema using Maven. This functionality is provided by the [Metaschema Maven plugin](metaschema-maven-plugin/).
- A Java parser for reading and writing XML, JSON, or YAML into Java beans generated by this framework. This functionality is provided by the [Metaschema Java Binding Parser](metaschema-java-binding/).
- XML and JSON schema generation based on a Metaschema provided by [Netaschema Schema Generator](metaschema-schema-generator/).
